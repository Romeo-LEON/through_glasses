Hello !👋🏻
This repository is dedicated to a team project that occured in the scope of the course "processing with A.I" offered at emlyon business school.

More precisely, my team was challenged to develop a concept that could improve blind's people mobility and "social interactions". Our idea is simple, to provide glasses that would bring protection and guidance to visually impaired people.

The key tools/methods we use are listed below :

- Google vision kit
- 3D printer
- Laser cutter
- Python 3
- User research / testing

I invite you to discover the project comprehensively by downloading the pitch and see the notion page [here](https://www.notion.so/PwAI-Group-2-6370c9d199f94e91b910cec70876aa29)! Happy reading 😄
